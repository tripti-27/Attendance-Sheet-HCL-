It is my privilege to work on the project “Attendance Record” at Hindustan Copper Limited,Indian Copper Complex, Ghatsila. At the very outset, I am obliged to HINDUSTAN COPPER LIMITED for the permission to undertake training program and provides me the basic infrastructure and facilities. I express my heartfelt gratitude to Mrs Neha Tiwari DM(E)- HR who guided me throughout this project. I would also like to thank Mr RAVI SHANKAR CHOUDHARY Manager (HR&A) for his continuous assistance without which this project would not have been reached at completion. It is this spirit, of being associated with the System department in particular and HCL in general who inspired me to complete this project successfully. I am deeply grateful to Mr SANJEEV KUMMAR CM(System), my Internal Guide , who provided valuable insights and guidance at every stage of the project. I also convey my sincere gratitude to my friends and my family for their encouragement and Support extended to me during the course of my project. At the end I would not forget to thank the members of HCL/ICC, MOUBHANDAR who treated me with respect and helped me in the best of their capacity
